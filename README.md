# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Employee Database with SQL

## Overview of Analysis
Pewlett Hackard would like to prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami". The purpose of this analysis was to see how many employees are retiring by title and in further preparation, see which retiring employees would be eligible to particpate in a mentorhsip program.

## Results and Code
### Regarding specific deliverables...
- The largest number of retiring titles is Engineers and the least are Managers, implying at this current moment, management has either already gone through the turnover or hasn't yet while the more technical positions will experience the biggest hole

- Utilzing DISTINCT ON () implies many employees experienced promotions over their tenure, which should be encouraging to current, non-retirement eligible employees as well as future employees
-There are 1549 employees eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary
As the "silver tsunami" roles in, 7 roles in varying ways, will need to be filled. With over 120,000 employees retiring and a little over 1500 employees eligible for the mentorship program, there are plenty of qualified, retirement-ready employees to help mentor the next generation. And mentors will be able to be matched to appropriate roles, as all mentoring roles have a host of retirment-ready employees to be matched with.
